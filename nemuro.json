  "description": "Nemuro-kun sits next to me. He always hides his face with his bangs, and most people at school do not know his real face. One day, Takamura happened to know his face, and she couldn't take his eyes off Nemuro-kun! I love Nemuro-kun's face. But that is all I know. This is a school love comedy that begins with a face, where they gradually get to know each other!",
